# xset is used to set various user preference options of the display.
# The s option lets you set the screen saver parameters.  This option accepts up to two  numerical
# parameters,  a  'blank/noblank'  flag,  an  'expose/noexpose'  flag, an 'on/off' flag, an 'acti‐
# vate/reset' flag, or the 'default' flag.  If no parameters or the 'default' flag  is  used,  the
# system  will be set to its default screen saver characteristics.  The 'on/off' flags simply turn
# the screen saver functions on or off.  The 'activate' flag forces  activation  of  screen  saver
# even  if  the  screen saver had been turned off.  The 'reset' flag forces deactivation of screen
# saver if it is active.  The 'blank' flag sets the preference to blank the video (if the hardware
# can do so) rather than display a background pattern, while 'noblank' sets the preference to dis‐
# play a pattern rather than blank the video.  The 'expose' flag sets the preference to allow win‐
# dow exposures (the server can freely discard window contents), while 'noexpose' sets the prefer‐
# ence to disable screen saver unless the server can regenerate the screens without causing  expo‐
# sure events.  The length and period parameters for the screen saver function determines how long
# the  server  must  be inactive for screen saving to activate, and the period to change the back‐
# ground pattern to avoid burn in.  The arguments are specified in seconds.  If only one numerical
# parameter is given, it will be used for the length.
